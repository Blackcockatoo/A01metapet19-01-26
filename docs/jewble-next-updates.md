# Jewble Meta-Pet: Next Updates Playbook

This playbook turns the current hit-list into execution lanes so you can move fast without dropping essentials.

## Ruthless priority order

1. **ICT proof pack + pilot stability**
2. **Teacher kit polish**
3. **Outreach cadence + tracking discipline**
4. **Landing page + stable demo distribution**
5. **Regulator submission pack**

---

## Product updates (pilot stability first)

### Non-negotiables

- Classroom Mode toggle (faster start, fewer clicks, predictable session timing)
- Zero-network hard lock with visible **Offline Verified** state and self-check
- Teacher controls: reset pet, pause/sleep, end-session ritual, volume/mute, brightness-safe UI
- Device robustness across older laptops, Chromebooks, and iPads without account friction
- Failure-proof saves with safe recovery and restart-without-loss path

### High-leverage nice-to-haves

- Projector-friendly whole-class view
- Accessibility pass (dyslexia-friendly font options, contrast, reduced motion, keyboard navigation)

---

## ICT proof pack (convert trust into verification)

Build a compact package schools can validate quickly:

- 1-page **Network Audit Quickstart** (DevTools + firewall check flow)
- Architecture sheet (offline-first, no SDKs, no analytics, no accounts)
- Crypto identity explainer (what it is, why it matters, what never leaves device)
- Threat model lite (risks removed by architecture)
- Privacy policy URL (explicitly states zero collection)

---

## Classroom kit updates (plug-and-play for teachers)

- Tight facilitation scripts with 20-minute timing blocks
- Printable worksheet pack (reflection + systems thinking + wellbeing language)
- Optional session slides
- Troubleshooting quick sheet (install, launch, reset, student distress flow)
- Short curriculum alignment table (specific outcomes, no fluff)

---

## Outreach tracker upgrades (pipeline discipline)

- Add principal names and direct emails wherever possible
- Follow-up cadence automations (Day 7 / Day 14 / final bump)
- Status taxonomy: `NEW → SENT → FOLLOW-UP DUE → RESPONDED → MEETING → PILOT RUNNING → DONE`
- Email template chooser: cold / warm / follow-up / ICT-forward
- KPI panel: sent, response rate, meetings, pilots started, conversion

---

## Distribution updates (remove friction)

- `jewble.app` landing page with:
  - 60-second explanation
  - download/launch link
  - privacy proof links
  - pilot outline PDF
  - booking link
- Netlify deployment with stable demo URL
- Screenshot/press asset folder (app shots, logo, hero image)
- Store prep after pilot hardening:
  - iOS/Android listing copy
  - kids-category compliance checklist
  - family-safe positioning without tracking

---

## Top-down authority updates (regulator lane)

- Ready-to-send OAIC submission with annex:
  - compliance-by-design checklist
  - school ed-tech architecture evaluation rubric
  - zero-collection reference implementation
- Versioned regulator pack separate from school-facing pitch
- Maintain a current "why this matters now" paragraph

---

## Traction + story updates (investor/partner signal)

- Pilot outcome template (teacher quote, week-1 change, student learning evidence)
- Roadmap slide (post-pilot feature + distribution path)
- Budget + ask slide (what funding buys: time, polish, certification, rollout)

---
