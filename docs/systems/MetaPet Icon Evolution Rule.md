# MetaPet Icon Evolution Rule (When & Why It Changes)

## Principle

The icon reflects the relationship, not time. It changes when the user’s behavior or intent crosses meaningful thresholds.

## States & Triggers

### Meta Egg (Default / Potential)

- **When:** First install, or after long, gentle inactivity (optional reset).
- **Why:** Signals untapped potential and invites care without pressure.

### Meta Beast (Bonded / Mischief)

- **When:** Consistent care over a short window (e.g., 3–5 days) with no severe neglect.
- **Why:** The pet recognizes trust and interaction (feed, play, check-ins, naming).

### Meta Core (Sacred / Advanced)

- **When:** Intent-based interactions (lore/rituals/settings/reflection), or explicit user choice via a “Ritual Toggle.”
- **Why:** Indicates deeper recognition—seeing the pet as symbolic, not just cute.

## Reversion (Kind, Not Punitive)

- **Beast → Egg:** After long inactivity (weeks, not days). The pet “withdraws” rather than “dies.”
- **Core → Beast:** If usage becomes purely utilitarian (no ritual/intent interactions).

## Optional Seasonal Mask

Temporary icon shifts on rare events (solstice, anniversary, major update). Cosmetic only.
