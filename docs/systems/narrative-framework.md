# Narrative Framework: Restore the Echoed Biome

## Premise
A once-thriving digital ecosystem called the **Echoed Biome** has fractured after a data storm scrambled its genetic archives. Players act as **Biome Stewards**, guiding a bonded creature (the MetaPet) and its habitat to re-stabilize biodiversity. Progress is tracked through **milestones** that map directly to learning outcomes about inheritance, variation, and environmental influence.

## Core Loop
1. **Observe** ecosystem signals (resource balance, trait shifts, survival rates).
2. **Act** through stewardship choices (breeding, habitat tuning, stress testing).
3. **Reflect** on inheritance outcomes and environmental pressures.
4. **Unlock** new traits, constraints, or adaptive pressures.

## Milestone Path with Learning Outcomes

### Milestone 1: Rehydrate the Seedbank
- **Narrative Beat**: Recover fragmented genetic records and reintroduce foundational traits.
- **Learning Outcome**: Distinguish inherited traits from acquired changes; recognize baseline genetic diversity.
- **Unlocks**:
  - **Trait**: “Ancestral Resonance” (reveals trait lineage origins).
  - **Environmental Pressure**: Mild nutrient scarcity (forces trade-offs in trait expression).
- **Reflection Questions**:
  - Which traits appeared without direct intervention, and what does that suggest about inheritance?
  - How did limited nutrients affect trait expression versus trait inheritance?

### Milestone 2: Balance the Pollinators
- **Narrative Beat**: Stabilize cross-pollination by supporting multiple species interactions.
- **Learning Outcome**: Explain how mixing lineages introduces variation and how dominance influences visible traits.
- **Unlocks**:
  - **Trait**: “Hybrid Bloom” (allows controlled cross-lineage breeding).
  - **Environmental Pressure**: Seasonal flux (periodic shifts that favor different traits).
- **Reflection Questions**:
  - When two lineages combined, which traits dominated and why?
  - How did seasonal shifts change which inherited traits were most advantageous?

### Milestone 3: Stabilize the Thermal Ridge
- **Narrative Beat**: Restore temperature gradients that allow niche specialization.
- **Learning Outcome**: Connect phenotype changes to environmental selection rather than genetic change.
- **Unlocks**:
  - **Trait**: “Thermal Adaptation” (traits express differently across zones).
  - **Environmental Pressure**: Heat spikes (stress tests for resilience).
- **Reflection Questions**:
  - Which traits persisted across zones, and which were sensitive to temperature?
  - How can a trait be inherited but still appear differently in different environments?

### Milestone 4: Reweave the Food Web
- **Narrative Beat**: Rebuild predator-prey balance to prevent trait collapse.
- **Learning Outcome**: Describe how selection pressures can shift trait frequencies across generations.
- **Unlocks**:
  - **Trait**: “Adaptive Foraging” (modulates survival odds by trait synergy).
  - **Environmental Pressure**: Scarcity cycles (resource pulses that reward efficient inheritance patterns).
- **Reflection Questions**:
  - Which inherited traits became more common after repeated scarcity cycles?
  - How did the food web pressures change the success of certain lineages?

### Milestone 5: Archive the Living Genome
- **Narrative Beat**: Finalize a resilient genomic archive that can withstand future storms.
- **Learning Outcome**: Synthesize how inheritance, variation, and environment interact over time.
- **Unlocks**:
  - **Trait**: “Legacy Imprint” (marks stable, multi-generation traits).
  - **Environmental Pressure**: Randomized anomaly events (simulate long-term uncertainty).
- **Reflection Questions**:
  - Which traits proved stable across generations, and what inheritance patterns supported them?
  - How would you design the next generation to endure unpredictable changes?

## Optional Side Quests (Reinforcement)
- **Gene Drift Audit**: Track a low-frequency trait across three generations and predict its persistence.
- **Trait Rescue Mission**: Reintroduce a lost trait using ancestry mapping tools.
- **Phenotype vs. Genotype Journal**: Log one trait weekly, noting whether changes were inherited or environmentally induced.

## Assessment Notes
- Each milestone should be accompanied by a **brief reflection entry** (2–3 sentences) answering the questions.
- Use trait lineage tracking to make explicit connections between **inheritance patterns** and **environmental pressures**.
