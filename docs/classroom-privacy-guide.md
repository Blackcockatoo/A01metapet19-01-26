# Classroom Privacy Guide

## Overview
The Classroom Management dashboard is designed for school environments that require privacy-by-default workflows. All classroom data is stored locally in the browser on the device running MetaPet. The feature avoids collecting student names or IDs and focuses on anonymized, aggregated insights.

## What data is stored
- **Roster aliases**: Teacher-entered nicknames or class-safe aliases (for example, “Bluebird 4”). Avoid full names, student IDs, or other personally identifiable information.
- **Assignments**: Activity titles, focus areas, and target minutes.
- **Progress status**: A simple status per learner per assignment (“Not started,” “In progress,” “Complete”).

## How data is processed
- **Local-only storage**: Roster, assignments, and progress tracking are stored in the browser’s local storage on the classroom device.
- **Aggregated analytics**: Completion rates and totals are calculated on-device. Analytics are stored separately as totals only (no aliases, IDs, or individual records).
- **No network transmission**: This feature does not send classroom data to external servers.

## Anonymization details
- Aggregated analytics only contain counts and percentages.
- Individual identifiers are not included in analytics summaries.
- Aliases are teacher-entered and should not be unique identifiers.

## Reset and retention controls
- **Reset progress**: Clears all progress statuses while keeping the roster and assignments.
- **Clear aggregated analytics**: Deletes the stored totals and completion rates.
- **Reset classroom data**: Removes roster, assignments, and progress data entirely.

## Compliance guidance
- Use aliases that cannot be linked back to a specific student.
- Store data only on authorized devices.
- Reset classroom data when a term ends or when devices are shared.
- Review this guide alongside district policies for FERPA, COPPA, or local requirements.
