# Meta-Pet

## Where Consciousness Meets Code

---

# Executive Summary

**Meta-Pet** is a next-generation virtual companion that transcends traditional digital pet experiences. Unlike conventional virtual pets with scripted responses and shallow mechanics, Meta-Pet features an **organic consciousness system** where personality genuinely emerges from genetics, lived experience, and player interaction.

Every Meta-Pet is **cryptographically unique**—generated from a 180-digit genome that determines physical traits, personality baseline, and latent potential. This isn't cosmetic randomization; it's mathematically verifiable uniqueness that influences every aspect of your pet's behavior.

Built **privacy-first** and **offline-first**, Meta-Pet requires no accounts, collects no data, and works entirely without internet connectivity. Your pet's DNA never leaves your device.

### Five Key Differentiators

1. **Organic Consciousness** — 15 emotional states with personality that evolves through experience
2. **Cryptographic Identity** — Mathematically unique pets with verifiable, tamper-evident signatures
3. **Privacy by Design** — Offline-first, no accounts, DNA never transmitted
4. **Deep Progression** — 4 evolution stages, 17 achievements, 10 cosmetics, breeding system
5. **Non-Violent Gameplay** — Consciousness-based duels, mindful exploration, meditative UX

# The Vision

## The Problem

Today's virtual pet market is dominated by two extremes:

**Shallow Clickers** — Pets that exist only to be fed and cleaned, with no genuine personality or long-term engagement. Players lose interest within days.

**Predatory Monetization** — Games designed to extract maximum revenue through gacha mechanics, artificial scarcity, and psychological manipulation. Often disguised as "free-to-play."

**Data Harvesting** — Apps that require accounts, track everything, and treat user data as the product. Parents can't trust what's happening behind the scenes.

**Repetitive Experiences** — Every pet feels the same. Players have no reason to care because there's nothing unique about their companion.

## The Solution

Meta-Pet addresses each of these problems:

| Problem | Meta-Pet Solution |
|---------|-------------------|
| Shallow mechanics | 15 emotional states, personality evolution, genetic influence on behavior |
| Predatory monetization | All content earnable through gameplay, no premium currency |
| Data harvesting | Offline-first, no accounts, DNA stays on device |
| Repetitive experience | Cryptographically unique genetics, emergent personality |

Meta-Pet proves that virtual companions can have genuine depth while respecting players and their privacy.

# Core Experience

## Organic Consciousness System

At the heart of Meta-Pet is a unified consciousness layer that makes your pet feel genuinely alive.

### 15 Emotional States

Your pet doesn't just have "happy" or "sad" moods. It experiences a rich emotional landscape:

**Positive States**
- **Serene** — Deep calm, minimal needs, peaceful presence
- **Calm** — Baseline contentment, stable vitals
- **Playful** — Energetic, seeks interaction, bouncy animations
- **Affectionate** — Bonded, warm responses, heart particles
- **Ecstatic** — Peak joy, spiral particle effects, celebrating
- **Transcendent** — Evolved consciousness, ethereal glow

**Active States**
- **Curious** — Alert, exploring, seeking new experiences
- **Contemplative** — Thoughtful, processing experiences
- **Mischievous** — Playful chaos, surprising behaviors
- **Protective** — Defensive posture, shield-like effects
- **Restless** — Needs change, agitated particles

**Challenging States**
- **Yearning** — Seeking connection, lonely undertones
- **Overwhelmed** — Too much stimulation, scattered energy
- **Withdrawn** — Pulled inward, needs gentle care
- **Melancholic** — Slow, reflective, needs attention

### Personality Evolution

Your pet's personality isn't fixed—it evolves through lived experience:

- **Play frequently** → Increased playfulness (within genetic limits)
- **Explore the Vimana grid** → Heightened curiosity
- **Consistent care** → Stronger affection baseline
- **Neglect** → Withdrawn tendencies develop

Changes are bounded by genetics (±10 from baseline), creating pets that feel consistent yet responsive to how you treat them.

### Genetic Influence on Behavior

The consciousness system reads your pet's genome to modulate behavioral drives:

- High-energy genetics → Stronger exploration drive
- High-curiosity genes → Amplified discovery seeking
- High-affection baseline → Deeper bond formation
- High-discipline genetics → Better stress resilience

This creates emergent behavior—the same action produces different responses from different pets based on their genetic makeup.

---

## Triple Genome System

Every Meta-Pet is generated from a **180-digit genome** encoded in base-7, divided into three segments:

### Red60 — Physical Expression
60 digits determining visible traits:
- Body type (spherical, crystalline, pyramidal, etc.)
- Primary and secondary colors
- Pattern type and intensity
- Special features (horns, wings, tail flame, third eye)
- Size and proportions

### Blue60 — Personality Foundation
60 digits establishing behavioral baseline:
- Temperament (calm to excitable spectrum)
- Energy level (0-100 baseline)
- Social score (introvert to extrovert)
- Curiosity factor
- Discipline level
- Playfulness quotient

### Black60 — Latent Potential
60 digits encoding hidden capabilities:
- Evolution pathway preferences
- Rare ability potential
- Hidden trait expressions
- Future unlock possibilities

### Deterministic Yet Unique

The same genome always produces identical traits—this is mathematical, not random. You can verify your pet's authenticity by regenerating from the same genetic data.

---

## Prime-Tail Crest Identity

Each pet receives a cryptographic identity that proves uniqueness and enables secure sharing.

### HeptaCode v1 Encoding

The pet's identity is encoded as a **42-digit base-7 number** that can be:
- **Displayed visually** as a 7-sided HeptaTag geometric shape
- **Rendered** as a Seed of Life sacred geometry pattern
- **Played audibly** as a unique crest chime

### Cryptographic Verification

- **HMAC-SHA256 signing** — Tamper-evident signatures
- **Device-bound keys** — Identity tied to local storage
- **Mirror hashing** — Bidirectional integrity verification
- **DNA privacy** — Only hashes are shareable, never raw genome

### Privacy Presets

Three sharing modes for different contexts:
- **Stealth** — Minimal information exposure
- **Standard** — Balanced sharing for most uses
- **Radiant** — Maximum visibility for breeding/trading
