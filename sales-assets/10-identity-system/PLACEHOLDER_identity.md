# Identity System Screenshots

Capture the unique cryptographic identity visualization.

## HeptaTag Visualization
- 7-sided geometric shape
- Derived from pet's 42-digit HeptaCode
- Unique colors based on genome
- Rotation animation if capturing GIF

## Seed of Life Glyph
- Sacred geometry pattern
- Rendered from same identity data
- Interconnected circles pattern

## Prime-Tail Crest
- Full cryptographic identity display
- Crest signature visualization
- DNA hash indicators (never raw DNA)

## Privacy Presets (if visible)
- Stealth mode indicator
- Standard mode indicator
- Radiant mode indicator

## Key Points for Screenshots
- These visualizations represent mathematical uniqueness
- Same identity renders identically every time
- Demonstrate that identity is verifiable but private

## How to Access
Look for identity panel in main pet view or digital key panel

## Dimensions
600x600 for each visualization

## Usage
Showcasing cryptographic uniqueness and privacy-first design
