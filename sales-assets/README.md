### Capture Tips

3. Capture at 2x resolution for retina displays
4. For GIFs, use screen recording software (LICEcap, ScreenToGif)
5. Ensure pet has good vitals for best animations

### File Naming
Replace placeholder `.md` files with actual images:
- `PLACEHOLDER_hero-main.md` → `hero-main.png`
- Keep the descriptive name, just change extension

## Quick Start

1. Review each placeholder file for capture instructions
2. Capture screenshots in priority order (HIGH first)
3. Replace `.md` files with `.png` or `.gif` files
4. Delete placeholder files after replacing
