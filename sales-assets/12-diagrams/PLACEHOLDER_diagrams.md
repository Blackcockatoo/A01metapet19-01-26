# Diagrams to Create

These diagrams should be created (not screenshots) to explain systems visually.

## Architecture Overview
Create a high-level diagram showing:
- Client-side only architecture
- IndexedDB for persistence
- Web Crypto API for identity
- Zustand for state
- NO server connections (privacy-first)

**Do NOT include**: Algorithm details, code structure, implementation specifics

## Consciousness Flow
Create a flow diagram showing:
- Genetics → Personality baseline
- Actions → Personality modulation
- Vitals → Emotional state
- Emotional state → Response selection

**Key message**: Emergent behavior, not scripted

## Evolution Progression
Create a timeline/ladder showing:
- GENETICS → NEURO → QUANTUM → SPECIATION
- Time requirements at each stage
- Vitals requirements
- What unlocks at each stage

## Competitor Comparison Matrix
Create a comparison table:
| Feature | Meta-Pet | Tamagotchi | Neopets | Pou |
|---------|----------|------------|---------|-----|
| Emotional States | 15 | 3-5 | Limited | 3-4 |
| Privacy | Local Only | Basic | Account | Account |
| Offline | Full | Full | Limited | Partial |
| Genetic Uniqueness | Cryptographic | None | None | None |

## Tools to Use
- Figma, Miro, draw.io, or Canva
- Keep visual style consistent with app (dark theme, cyan/purple accents)

## Dimensions
1920x1080 or scalable SVG

## Usage
Technical buyers, architecture validation, competitive positioning
